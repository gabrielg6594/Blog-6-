## Context: 
Some of my takeaways that I have from giving my Expo elevator pitch is, I should go in depth a little more to show how easy it is to use and say what I can and will improve on in the future without others specifically asking for it. I have also learned that I should have experimented with Firebase in order to make the calendar more improved with having users for each person so that the events are saved. I should also add the option to edit and remove events for there to be more convenience for what the user wants to do. 

Some of my takeaways from the in-class presentation would be, I should have made the calendar more appealing and interesting for a user to use it. I should add an edit function as all it can do as of now is to add as many events that someone wants. Some simple features that could be added that was pointed out in some questions after my in-class presentation is that I can change the padding on the form that is taking information in order to add a new event as it might be blocked at times I should make it so that it won't happen to be blocked and still be accessible.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)

In my process I have made a calendar that functions in adding events and displays them temporarily using Javascript and Json while being done in a html file and using css in order to adjust the padding and border for the form. Some parts that I can improve in the future would be adding parts of Firebase in order to make the calendar user orientated by having a user make an account, sign in and then be able to have the events saved in that account. Another thing that I can add in the design is adding an edit or remove button or function that will remove or let the person edit the event as there is no way to get rid of certain events so far.

### Skills

Some skills that I have developed or picked up while working on this project is being able to understand JSON syntax and how it is and can be incorporated into different areas and be used for different reasons. Some of the skills that I have are good at understanding physics and the logic behind why something happens. I have learned part of the skill of writing out the logic of what a program is supposed to do and then trying to write out the code that will execute those functions that are wanted.
