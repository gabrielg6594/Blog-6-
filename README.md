## Context: 
Some of my takeaways that I have from giving my Expo elevator pitch is, I should go in depth a little more to show how easy it is to use and say what I can and will improve on in the furture without others specifacally asking for it. I have also learn that I should have experimented with Firebase in order to make the calendar more improved with having users for each person so that the events are saved. I should also add the option to edit and remove events for there to be more convience for what the user wants to do. 

Some of my takeaways from the in-class presentation would be, I should have made the calendar more appealing and intresting for a user to use it. I should add an edit function as all it can do as of now is to add as many events that someone wants. Some simple features that could be added that was pointed out in some questions after my in-class presenetation is that I can change the padding on the form that is taking information in order to add a new event as it might be blocked at times I should make it so that it wont happen to be blocked and still be accessable.

### Engeneering Design Process (EDP)

So far in my process I have made a working calendar that uses pre-input events to display them for different days that are chosen. I am trying to get the form or survey to make the responses go to the right place in order to go and then come back to put it into the calendar and show a new event.

### Skills

Some of the skills that I have is good at understanding physics and the logic behind things of why something happens. So the differences between some forces, how they are affected and different parts that would be important depending on the task.
